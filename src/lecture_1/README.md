Supervised learning is a machine learning algorithm that can map a dataset of inputs and outputs, finding a function that transforms the input into the corresponding output value

    - Regression problems are a type of machine learning problem where the result is a continuous function

    - A classification problem is a problem where the result can be a restricted set of values, such as 'is an apple' or 'is not an apple'.

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning algorithm that receives a dataset and discovers patterns within it

    - A reinforcement algorithm is a type of machine learning algorithm that learns from a dataset using parameters that reinforce what is good and what is bad. It is similar to training a dog: rewarding good behavior with a treat and punishing bad behavior
